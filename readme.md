#### Installation

You can download the latest release from [here](releases).

#### Building

If you're a developer, and want to build your own version, you must have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/) 14 installed, as well as [npm](https://npmjs.com) and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (not v15, sorry bleeding edge users)

Binaries are outputted in [/bin](/bin), and are built for Mac x64 and Windows x64. Support for Apple Silicon is dependent on Vercel's [pkg](https://npmjs.com/package/pkg)
